# AutoDeels - An auto trading app for the public

**My first ever android app!** Written in Java with android studio. 

This app was co-developed in my software project class with 2 other students. My main responsibillity was building app layout, implementing the back end functionallity and database component.

## Running the App
Download and run the **"AutoDeels.apk"**

Once you run the app you'll need to create an account to sign in to start exploring the app! This app was only built for a school project and isn't really built to work in reality so some functionalities might not work properly.

## DataBase 
This project uses Google Firebase

## About the bad code
This project was built and created simultaneously as I learn to build an android application so the project was not planned or designed very well before development began and therefore there is still a lot of redundancy and the code was just horribly written. Also, this project did have a strict deadline and a lot of rules and regulations. Overall, it was a fun experience of learning android development!
